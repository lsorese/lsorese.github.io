<p>My grandmother just sent me a text about something she saw on CNN.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey L., I’m watching something on CNN from Silicon Valley about a young men that are hacking and women that are hacking and it looks like stuff you’d be interested in love you grandma</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She lives in Florida with her husband; both retired with a puppy they treat like a baby. When you come to town, they will give you 5🌟 accomodations for the opportunity to spend time with them. They have a laptop they use to try to communicate with her family, but they tend to call you 9 times out of 10.</p>

<p>Their notion of technology is pretty clean. People learn to use computers, make things and get to paid to make things, just like everyone else has for centuries. It works like it always has.</p>

<p>But that concept isn’t entirely clear to me. I wouldn’t call myself a Luddite<sup id="fnref:Ted"><a href="#fn:Ted" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, but some of what he says makes a lot of sense. Technology destroys the environment, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bay-area-gentrification_us_56cdec76e4b041136f191b93">gentrify entire states</a> and makes multi-billion dollar companies who disrupt existing companies without turning any profit for decades.</p>

<p>There are questions as to how we intend to make the morals of AI correlate to human morals. What if we dedicate billions of dollars towards sorting out “The Control Problem”<sup id="fnref:Control"><a href="#fn:Control" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, but we never sort out the answer? In a random universe, we can’t be sure of the answer.</p>

<p>I’ve worked at a few technology companies and they mostly involved selling services. In-home tech support, Web Developer, Front-End Developer. They pay the bills and I can can perform the services well. I’ve always made a point to stay as far away from sales meetings as possible.</p>

<p>I’m not interested in selling anything to anyone unless I have a clear understanding of how much that thing is worth. $10,000? $300? I’m so incredibly unclear on how much any of this is worth.</p>
