  <time datetime="2016-11-01T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">01 Nov 2016</time>
  <h2 id="nano">Nano</h2>
<p>The month of November has began and that means only one thing<sup id="fnref:Few"><a href="#fn:Few" class="footnote">1</a></sup>; slacking off on NanoWriMo. There’s a subreddit for people who are trying, in earnest, to get this thing done, but most already sound pretty upset about their abilities on day one.</p>

<p>I’ve done pretty well at sticking to things for arbitrary amounts of time. I became a runner and lost 70lbs. I’ve switched to a dumbphone for a few months to get reacquainted with that it means to be <em>connected</em>. I’ve deleted social media and kept off of reddit for weeks.</p>

<p>But I can never seem to write for an extended amount of time.</p>

<p>I always wanted to be a writer. It’s even in my Myers-Briggs<sup id="fnref:Myers"><a href="#fn:Myers" class="footnote">2</a></sup> personality test that I probably want to be a writer.</p>

<p>There’s a fair amount of vanity in that quest. It’s really, really cool to be a writer. Being a writer makes a lot flaws fade away. It makes you seem smart and learned. It’d make myself feel more equipped for human life if I knew how to write about it. It’d make me feel like I know how this world works. I could build universes with my brain, put them onto paper and <em>I am a G*d among men, watch me create!</em></p>

<p>I don’t know what I’ll create, but I know I need to document first. I need to document what comes to my mind and not feel so precious about my ideas.</p>

<p>I’m not always feeling creative, but I can always do something.</p>

<h2 id="a-letter-to-ce">A Letter to C.E.</h2>
<p>It’s quite possible that where I’m sitting now in Downtown Las Vegas is the furthest west I’ve ever been. The sun may or may not be the greatest ever here, but it’s sure as hell not the humid nightmare that is Virginia.</p>

<p>Las Vegas has a lot to love. It’s open 24-hours so I can get Chinese food at 4am. Nearly anything you could want to do (and many you shouldn’t want to do) are legal here, so sometimes the atmosphere feels more like Bonnaroo than a city which is very freeing. Rent, food, and experiences are cheap.</p>

<p>The biggest negative is that you have to kind of check your ethics at the door. The financial crisis of ‘07 hit really hard over here and the unemployment rate is approaching double the national rate. There’s a HUGE homeless population that the city is, literally, trying to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beneath_the_Neon">sweep into the sewer system</a>. And the sex trade is huge and blatant and horrifying up close.</p>

<p>It’s up and coming for sure and the weirdness of legal vice takes a bit to get used to, but it’s not a bad place to spend a few years.</p>

<p>Also, everyone getting married is super easy to get used to, but I’m still not used to my friends having babies.</p>

<h2 id="a-letter-to-the-reader">A Letter to the Reader.</h2>
<p>A day ago, I deleted my posts off of Github<sup id="fnref:Which"><a href="#fn:Which" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. Something about embarrassment or being unimpressed by the work I had done thus far. I believe that that was a mistake and I am sorry for my quick and shitty judgement. Now, back to our regularly scheduled programming.</p>

<p>I was afraid that if someone read these posts in their current state, they’d think I was an idiot. With that said, I know how I scan the internet. If something isn’t interesting in 20 seconds, I dip and go somewhere else and forget about it immediately.</p>

<p>If someone comes across this blog and is interested in what I’m saying, write me an email. You can probably find it easy enough. Write me a letter and tell me what you’re interested in.</p>
